# About soucoup

Welcome! I'm the author behind this blog.

## What I Write About

- **AI & Machine Learning** - Practical tutorials and commentary on the AI revolution
- **Software Development** - Code, architecture, and best practices
- **Tech Industry** - Opinions and analysis on where things are heading

## The Blog

This site is built with Hugo and the Terminal theme, hosted on GitHub Pages. Every post is a markdown file, and the site rebuilds automatically when I merge a PR.

Why this setup? I wanted to own my content, write in markdown, and have a workflow that feels like coding.
